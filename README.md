These are my final prograrms for Advent of Code 20202 (https://adventofcode.com), a daily programming challenge.

Please don't take these as representative of my best work :) Its just a fun daily challenge and since the goal 
is to crank out two small programs a day that do the minimum necessary to solve the problem given, they tend
to be "quick and dirty".
